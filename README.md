## üìå Project Abstract

Fuzzy logic provides a way to model complex systems using human-like reasoning, making it ideal for control systems where inputs can be imprecise or subjective. This project, **Bulanƒ±k Mantƒ±k (Fuzzy Logic)**, was developed as an educational tool to showcase these concepts.

It implements a complete fuzzy inference system to control a simulated washing machine. Users can input crisp values for the laundry's **sensitivity, amount, and dirtiness**. The application then uses a set of fuzzy rules to determine the optimal **rotation speed, detergent amount, and washing time**. This project is unique because it builds the entire fuzzy logic engine from the ground up, without relying on external libraries, offering a clear view into the core mechanics of fuzzification, rule evaluation, and defuzzification.

## üß† The Fuzzy Logic Engine: A Deep Dive

The core of this application is a custom-built fuzzy logic controller. It follows the classic Mamdani inference model, which consists of four main steps:

### 1. Input Variables

The system takes three crisp (numerical) inputs from the user via track bars:
-   **Sensitivity (`Hassasiyet`):** How delicate the clothes are.
-   **Amount (`Miktar`):** The quantity of laundry in the machine.
-   **Dirtiness (`Kirlilik`):** How soiled the clothes are.

### 2. Fuzzification

The first step is to take these crisp inputs and translate them into fuzzy linguistic variables. The `Bulanƒ±k.cs` class handles this process. Each input is mapped to a degree of membership in several fuzzy sets (e.g., "Low," "Medium," "High") using predefined membership functions (likely triangular or trapezoidal).

For example, a "Dirtiness" value of 75 might be translated to:
-   `0.0` membership in "Low"
-   `0.25` membership in "Medium"
-   `0.75` membership in "High"

### 3. Rule Base & Inference

The decision-making brain of the system is a set of human-readable IF-THEN rules. These rules are defined in an external `kural.txt` file and loaded at runtime by the `Kural.cs` class. A typical rule looks like this:

`IF Sensitivity IS High AND Amount IS Medium AND Dirtiness IS High THEN RotationSpeed IS Slow AND Detergent IS Much AND WashTime IS Long`

The inference engine evaluates all rules in the rule base. For each rule, it takes the membership values from the fuzzification step and applies a fuzzy operator (typically `MIN` for `AND` conditions) to determine the "firing strength" of that rule. This strength is then used to clip the output fuzzy sets.

### 4. Defuzzification

After all rules have been evaluated, the system has a collection of clipped fuzzy output sets for Rotation Speed, Detergent Amount, and Wash Time. The `Durula≈ütƒ±r.cs` ("Defuzzify") class is responsible for converting these fuzzy outputs back into a single, crisp, and actionable number.

This is achieved using the **Center of Gravity (Centroid)** method, which calculates the weighted average of the combined output fuzzy sets. The result is a precise value that the washing machine can use, for example:
-   Rotation Speed: `850 RPM`
-   Detergent Amount: `110 ml`
-   Wash Time: `75 minutes`

## ‚ú® Application Features

The main UI (`Form1.cs`) provides an interactive dashboard to control and observe the fuzzy logic system in real-time.

-   **Interactive Inputs:** Use sliders (TrackBars) to adjust the crisp input values for Sensitivity, Amount, and Dirtiness.
-   **Real-Time Outputs:** Instantly see the calculated crisp output values for Rotation Speed, Detergent Amount, and Wash Time.
-   **Process Visualization:** The application displays the intermediate results, including the membership degrees for each input and the final calculated values, offering a clear insight into the decision-making process.
-   **Rule-Based Logic:** The entire control logic is driven by the easily editable `kural.txt` file, allowing for quick adjustments to the machine's behavior without changing the source code.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   **Visual Studio:** 2019 or 2022 with the ".NET desktop development" workload installed.
-   **.NET Framework:** Version 4.7.2 Developer Pack.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Bulanik-Mantik.git](https://github.com/your-username/Bulanik-Mantik.git)
    cd Bulanik-Mantik
    ```

2.  **Open in Visual Studio:**
    -   Launch Visual Studio.
    -   Open the `Bulanƒ±k Mantƒ±k.csproj` or the solution file (`.sln`).

3.  **Check the Rule File:**
    -   Ensure the `kural.txt` file exists in the `bin/Debug` directory of the project. This file is crucial for the application to load its decision-making rules.

4.  **Build the Project:**
    -   In the Visual Studio menu, select `Build` > `Build Solution` (or press `Ctrl+Shift+B`).

5.  **Run the Application:**
    -   Press `F5` or click the "Start" button in the toolbar to launch the application.
    -   Adjust the input sliders and click the "Hesapla" (Calculate) button to see the fuzzy logic controller in action.
